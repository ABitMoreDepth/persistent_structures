# persistent_structures

Collection of file-backed datastructures for use in python projects that require persistent data with familiar interfaces.


Inspired by some of the content of Raymond Hettinger's talk at Pycon Russia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ipdVNSFlo&t=783s.

This package provides a dictionary interface to the host file system.  As described during his talk, the FSDict class provides a lazy wrapper around the host file system, whilst presenting a MutableMapping interface to python applications.  This implementation supports working with subdirectories, by passing an FSDict instance back for any subdirectories encountered.

Currently tested only on 64bit linux.

Coming soon:
 - A similar interface to a file system, presented to python as a queue-like object, to allow python applications to easily make use of a persistent, disk backed queuing structure.
